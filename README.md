# Math-Misunderstanding_ML #

Sometimes, students have a misunderstanding of certain concepts in math. The underlying misunderstanding can be better understood based on their response and the reasoning behind it.
This ML classification task predicts what kind of misunderstanding is there based on students'based on students' responses. Following tools are used to investigate what algorithms perform better in this kind of multilabel classification task based on natural language:
-Multilabel classification algorithm
-TD-IDF Algorithm
-n-grams
-BERT Model
-Deep Learning
